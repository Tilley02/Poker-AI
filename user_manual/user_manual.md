# User Manual - Heads Up Poker

## Game Rules
Heads Up 1v1 Poker, often simply referred to as "Heads Up Poker," is a variant of traditional poker where two players compete against each other directly, as opposed to a full table of players. In this game, each player is dealt cards from a standard 52-card deck, and the objective is to win chips or money by either having the best hand at showdown or by forcing the opponent to fold.
