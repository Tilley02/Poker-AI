# User Manual - Heads Up Poker

## Game Rules
Heads Up 1v1 Poker, is a variant of traditional poker where two players compete against each other directly, as opposed to a full table of players. In this game, each player is dealt
 cards from a standard 52-card deck, and the objective is to win money by either having the best hand at showdown or by forcing the opponent to fold. Hands are determined from a 
 combination of community cards and 'pocket' cards. Community cards are the 5 cards in the middle of the table that slowly get revealed as the game progresses. Pocket cards are the 
 two cards unique to each player.

Additionally there are also forced bets called big and little blinds. These bets are used to stimulate action and ensure there is money in the pot for players to compete for. Big blind 
and little blind positions in Heads Up Poker will switch every hand to ensure fairness. Big blind bet is twice as much as the little blind bet. Both players must place these predetermined 
amount of chips into the pot before seeing their cards. Following this, if the little 
blind player decides they want to play the hand, they must call the big blind amount.

For example,
Big blind is 1000 chips and Small blind is 500 Chips. If Small blind decides they want to play the hand, they must bet another 500 chips so they match the Big blind amount. Due to this 
fact, small blind will always be first to play.

The rules of Heads Up Poker also state that these mandatory bets increase in amount after every hand. Big blind will start at 200, and Small blind will start at 100. After each hand, 
Big blind will increment by 200, while Small blind will increment by 100.

### Case: Players Have Hands of the Same Ranking
If both players have the same strength of hand, (e.g both have a pair), the winner will be determine by other factors. If a winner still can not be determined from these factors, the result 
will be a split pot. Since it is 1v1 Poker, this just means that both players will keep their bets, (No-one loses or wins money). The additional determining factors for winning a hand can 
vary between different hand rankings.

    High Card: 
    If both players have no pairs or other combinations, the player with the highest card wins. If the highest cards are equal, the next highest cards are compared, and so on until a winner 
    is determined. If both players have the same pocket cards, the result is a split pot.

    Pair: 
    If two players both have a pair, the player with the highest pair wins. If both pairs are equal, the player with the highest-ranking side card (kicker) wins. If the kickers are also the 
    same, the pot is split.

    Two Pair: 
    When comparing two hands with two pairs, the hand with the highest pair wins. If both players have the same highest pair, the second pair is considered. If both pairs are equal, the player
    with the highest-ranking kicker wins. If the kickers are also the same, the pot is split.

    Three of a Kind: 
    The player with the highest-ranking three of a kind wins. If both players have the same three of a kind, the highest-ranking kicker determines the winner.

    Straight: 
    The player with the higher straight will be the winner. For example, if player A had straight [3,4,5,6,7] and Player B had straight [4,5,6,7,8], Player B would be the winner. If both players 
    have the same straight, the pot will be split.

    Flush:
    The player with the higher card in their flush will be determined to be the winner. For example if two players both had diamond flushes, but Player A's flush was cards [2,4,5,7,9] and 
    Player B's flush cards were [2,4,5,7,11], Player B would be the winner. If both players have same flush cards, pot is split.

    Full House: 
    In a Full House scenario, the player with the highest-ranking set of three cards (known as the "three of a kind") wins. For instance, if Player A has three Kings and two Queens (KKKQQ) 
    and Player B has three Queens and two Kings (QQQKK), Player A would win since Kings are higher ranking than Queens.
    If both players have the same three of a kind (for example, both have three Kings), the player with the highest-ranking pair wins. If the pairs are also identical, the pot is split.

    Four of a Kind:
    In the case of Four of a Kind, the player with the highest-ranking set of four cards wins. For instance, if Player A has four Aces and Player B has four Kings, Player A would win as Aces 
    rank higher than Kings.
    If both players have the same four of a kind (for example, both have four Aces), the player with the highest-ranking kicker wins. If the kickers are also identical, the pot is split.

    Straight Flush, Royal Flush: 
    These hands don't typically result in ties between players because of the rarity of such occurrences, except for in the case where this hand is located entirely in the community cards, 
    in which case the pot would be split.

## Check, Call, Raise and Fold Buttons
There are 6 different buttons the player can use during gameplay. The main ones are the Check, Call, Raise and Fold Buttons:

**Fold Button:**
    The player will fold the hand and lose any chips they have already betted. The AI will win the hand.

**Check Button:**
    The player does not want to raise or fold, they want to keep the bet the same and reveal more cards.

**Raise Button:**
    The player wants to increase the current bet. The minimum increase is 100 chips and the maximum is for the player to
    bet all their chips and go 'All In'. Once a player clicks on this button, they will be brought to the raise screen shown
    below:
![alt text](image-5.png)
On this screen a player can increase and decrease their bets by clicking the 'up' arrow to increase raise and 'down' arrow to decrease 
raise. There are a few functionalities added to make it as easy as possible to change this ammount. The player can control the increase of
the raise through different mouse clicks

**Left Mouse Button:**
When using the Left Mouse Button to click on the arrows, the raise will increase/decrease 100 for each click.

**Right Mouse Button:**
When using the Right Mouse Button to click on the arrows, the raise will increase/decrease 1000 for each click.

**Middle Mouse Button:**
When clicking on 'up' arrow, this will maximise the raise amount the player can do.
When clicking on the 'down' arriw this will decrease the raise amount to the minimum of 100.

**Call Button:**
The Player will call the AI's bet. This means they want to bet the same amount as the AI has, (Don't want to raise or fold).

Its important to note that only three of these buttons are avaialble to a player at any one time. While Fold and Raise are always
available to the player, the Check and Call button availability is determined by the current situation in the game. If it is the player's
turn and their bet is the same as the AI, (The AI hasn't raised), the check button will be avaiable, (There is no bet to call).
However, if the player hasnt matched the AI's bet, the call button will be available, (As you cannot check when there is a raised bet).
