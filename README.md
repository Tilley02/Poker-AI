# Heads up Poker AI

## Overview
This project aimed to develop a poker AI capable of competing against human opponents in heads-up play. The AI was crafted using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically utilizing decision tree algorithms.

## Methodology
The development process involved several key steps:

1. **Data Sourcing and Preparation:** Data relevant to poker gameplay was sourced, cleaned, and formatted to serve as the training dataset for the AI. This data was stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval.
2. **Machine Learning Training:** The decision tree algorithm was applied to the prepared dataset. Through supervised learning, the AI was trained to make strategic decisions based on the input features extracted from the game data.
3. **Integration into Poker Environment:** Once trained, the AI was integrated into the poker game environment, enabling it to interact with and compete against human opponents in heads-up matches.

## Features
* Utilizes decision tree algorithm for strategic decision-making.
* Trained on a comprehensive dataset sourced from real poker gameplay.
* Implemented within a poker game environment for practical application.

## Future Development
* Further optimization and refinement of AI's decision-making capabilities.
* Exploration of additional machine learning techniques for enhanced performance.
* Expansion for different variants of poker.
