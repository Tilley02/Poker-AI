Project Description (1-2 pages) (250 words): 

Heads-up Poker is one-on-one poker in which the blinds (mandatory bets) increase 
as the game progresses. Waiting for a good hand is not an optimum strategy. 
Information contained in an opponent's betting should be used to determine how 
strong their hand is. This will be done based on stats and how they have previously 
bet with different strength hands. Then based on that the AI will decide what to do 
i.e., bet, fold or call.
This project looks to create an AI opponent that learns from a player's behaviour 
based on real time on the opponent they are playing and responds accordingly based 
on how they bet with certain hands, how much they bet, how long they take to play 
and how often they play hands. To start, the AI will have a general method in which 
they will play that involves decisions such as checking, betting and folding based on 
certain strengths of hands that are ranked by statistics and then as the game 
progresses, this method will change based on the statistics collected on the 
opponent by the AI and the use of pattern recognition to see how the opponent 
played previous hands before and if they are playing similarly again.
The goal of this project is to build an AI that can confidently read the opponents 
hands after playing a few hands with them using statistical analysis, human 
behaviour, and betting or checking. 
For the game's interface, we will be using Unreal Engine. The game should allow the 
player to fold/raise/call/check against our AI and see what moves the AI is making, 
in response to them.
For the game to work, we will have to simulate a consistently shuffled deck of cards. 
Cards from this simulated deck should then be dealt, and the game should be able 
determine a winner based on the strength of each player's hand. We may also 
include different audio cues and visual effects for this. We will then have to undergo 
rigorous testing and debugging, as well as optimisation to get the game running as 
smoothly as possible.

Division of work:
Workload will be evenly divided between us. We will both have an equal part in 
coding/designing the:
*	Computer AI
*	The Poker Game itself.
*	User Interface

For the User Manual and Technical Specification, we will undertake one of the 
following approaches.
*	One Person does the Manual and the other the Specification.
*	Both contribute to the design of the Manual and Specification

Programming Languages:
*	Python
*	C
*	C++
*	JavaScript 
 


Programming Tools:
*	Visual Studio Code
*	GitLab
*	Unreal Engine
*	SQL

Learning Challenges (i.e., things you will have to learn):
*	Learn how to code and design a playable computer poke in Unreal Engine.
*	How to effectively implement SQL databases.
*	How to play poker
*	Stats for different hands
*	What makes an aggressive player versus a passive player?
*	How to build a profile on a player based on how they play to see if they will bluff or 
not
*	To teach the computer how to bet based on what cards they have, the cards shown and 
the profile they are building on the opponent.
*	How to make a computer AI that can accurately predict whether a player is bluffing or 
not.
 

Hardware/Software platform (i.e., platform for development e.g., PC or Linux):
*	PC

Special Hardware/ Software Requirements: 
*	None
