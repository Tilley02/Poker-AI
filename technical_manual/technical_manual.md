## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Provides a brief (half page) overview of the system/product that was developed. Include a description of how it works with other systems (if appropriate).

The heads up

### Glossary <a name="glossary"></a>

Define any technical terms used in this document. Only include those with which the reader may not be familiar.

## System Architecture <a name="system-architecture"></a>

This section describes the high-level overview of the system architecture, showing the distribution functions across (potential) system modules. Architectural components that are reused or 3rd party should be highlighted. Unlike the architecture in the Functional Specification, this description must reflect the design components of the system as it is demonstrated.

## High-Level Design <a name="high-level-design"></a>

This section should set out the high-level design of the system. It should include system models showing the relationship between system components and the systems and its environment. These might be object-models, DFD, etc. Unlike the design in the Functional Specification, this description must reflect the design of the system as it is demonstrated.

## Problems and Resolution <a name="problems-and-resolution"></a>

This section should include a description of any major problems encountered during the design and implementation of the system and the actions that were taken to resolve them.

Talk about data preprocessing problems here i.e. the problems with getting data, setting up tables, formatting etc.

## Installation Guide <a name="installation-guide"></a>

This is a 1 to 2 page section which contains a step-by-step software installation guide. It should include a detailed description of the steps necessary to install the software, a list of all required software, components, versions, hardware, etc.

## Future Work <a name="future-work"></a>

Possible section to add in tbd

Discuss potential future enhancements or extensions to the poker AI system. This could include improving the AI's strategy, incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques, etc.
