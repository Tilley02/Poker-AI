- Game Logic is complete
- User interface is complete - SFX, music, title screen, settings etc...
- Documented some of the process so it can be copied over to blog.

Finish coding AI and then code implement AI model. TENSORFLOW modelling

PLAN so by next friday game is fully playable against AI.

LAST Week can be used to add luxury features, test with users, complete video walkthrough.


Started code for AI and determined way of handling preflop betting
The Chen formula is a system for scoring different starting hands in Texas Holdâ€™em.


----------------------------------{ Pre-Flop }----------------------------------
Code the same way as five nights at freddies?
for starting hands...
Chen formula goes up to 20.
if chen score is 16, there is a 16/20 chance of the AI raising.
if not, the computer will check. 

if chen score is 0 or less on the first 5 turns, the AI will check

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------FOR OTHER STATES-------------

for other hands scoring system for the cards and do the same things.

Perhaps use a model for this?

We also have to consider player actions to determine this score
if they check do this to score
if they raise a small amount, large amount.

Model can influence the particular score for that state, based on how the other player has been playing.


-----------QUESTIONS----------------
1. for base strategy I can use this to determine how they can bet but dont want it to be hard-coded?
perhaps use a model for this?

2. Should there even be a fold function?

3. What is a good way to determine how much the AI should raise? Use a scoring system to help determine?

4. Is video walkthrough a walkthrough of the code and how it works, or just a playthrough of the game showing it function?     
(Each team is required to submit a video walkthrough of their project that shows the major features of the project in action.
 This video should be no more than 15 minutes in length. The video walkthrough is assessed. )
 1 in person, 3 by zoom.
