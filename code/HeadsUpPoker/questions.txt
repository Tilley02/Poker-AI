- Game Logic is complete
- User interface is complete - SFX, music, title screen, settings etc...
- Documented some of the process so it can be copied over to blog.

Finish coding AI and then code implement AI model. TENSORFLOW modelling

PLAN so by next friday game is fully playable against AI.

LAST Week can be used to add luxury features, test with users, complete video walkthrough.


Started code for AI and determined way of handling preflop betting
The Chen formula is a system for scoring different starting hands in Texas Holdâ€™em.


----------------------------------{ Pre-Flop }----------------------------------
Code the same way as five nights at freddies?
for starting hands...
Chen formula goes up to 20.
if chen score is 16, there is a 16/20 chance of the AI raising.
if not, the computer will check. 

if chen score is 0 or less on the first 5 turns, the AI will check

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------FOR OTHER STATES-------------

for other hands scoring system for the cards and do the same things.

Perhaps use a model for this?

We also have to consider player actions to determine this score
if they check do this to score
if they raise a small amount, large amount.

Model can influence the particular score for that state, based on how the other player has been playing.


-----------QUESTIONS----------------

Game Logic Complete
UI is nearly complete but subject to small changes
AI coded for preflop getting started on other game states. (Done by or before friday)
implement model on top of this to determine AI action.
