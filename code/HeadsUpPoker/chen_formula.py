----------------------------------{ Pre-Flop }----------------------------------
Chen formula goes up to 20, (Pair of Aces Suited).
If the chen score for the AI's starting hand is 16, there will be a 16/20 chance of the AI raising.
if not, the computer will check. 

Additionally if the AI's chen score is 0 or less on the first 5 turns, the AI will fold.
